# LeetCode Problems/Solutions

A small repository dedicated to my own solutions to various leetcode problems done inside of Visual Studio 2019.

The first iteration of questions were tested with XUnit on .NET Core 3.0. The second set now has a much easier testbed boilerplate, and is tested with NUnit on .NET 5

All committed items have been solved and submitted as answers.
